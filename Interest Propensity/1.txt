i have a csv file, i want to drop all the columns except:
Height_Source, Height_Target, Gender_Target, Gender_Source
also drop the rows that consists of null values. Save this dataframe as Height_data.csv

now my cloumns: Height_Source, Height_Target are in string format that i.e: like this, 5.00 feet
5.03 feet,5.06 feet,5.08 feet
i want these in the format below:
5.00,5.03,5.06,5.08
that is remove the feet.

my csv file contains now 4 columns:
Height_Source,Height_Target,Gender_Target,Gender_Source
Height_Source refers to the height of an individual whose gender is present in Gender_Source
Height_Target refers to the height of an individual whose gender is present in Gender_Target
make a new dataframe which contains 2 columns Height and Gender, correctly map the height and gender in this dataframe

now, what i want is to get the averge height for male and female for this dataframe

Drop these Unique values in column 'Height':
[Height_Source,Parent,Self,Never Married,Divorced,Electronics/Telecommunication,Widow / Widower,Awaiting Divorce,Mechanical,Relative,Height_Target]
Unique values in column 'Gender':
['Male' 'Female']


age > Drop rows
height > average
rest > None


in my csv file in column: 
Gender_Source remove the rows containing value as 'Gender_Source'
Gender_Source remove the rows containing value as 'Gender_Source'
Gender_Source remove the rows containing value as 'Gender_Source'
Gender_Source remove the rows containing value as 'Gender_Source'
Gender_Source remove the rows containing value as 'Gender_Source'
